# Julia-Playground
Collection of code experiments in Julia. I'm doing this in Jupyter notebooks running the latest Julia kernel release (v. 1.0.0 at the time of the initial commit)

* `Bell Numbers.ipynb` - an implementation of Bell numbers. Illustrates high-precision calculations using BigFloat and BigInt types.
* `Bf.ipynb` - An implementation of brainfuck programming language in Julia
* `Shoelace Formula.ipynb` - an implementation of the shoelace formula for computing the area of a polygon.
